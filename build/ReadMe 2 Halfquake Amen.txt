Story:
------
You live your everyday life. Work, family, house, children - whatever.
But one day you get caught in an absolutely dark, surrealistic and
sadistic world called Halfquake. Is it an institution? Is it on
earth? No-one seems to care about you, your pain and your life.
Forget your past, it's gone forever. Just pray it won't be too
sadistic.

Amen.

Known Bugs:

------
- Once you've activated a life cell you can walk into it at any

  One's enough to open the next room.
